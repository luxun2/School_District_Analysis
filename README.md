# School_District_Analysis

## A summary of your findings

In this module we learned many powerful functions in the pandas library and the data containers that we can use to manage information from .csv files. 
We have discovered that some of the data we imported had to be dropped, and other preparations such as changing strings to ints had to be performed before we could work with the data. 
We can easily describe statistical outputs of the data with the describe function. Some notable findings in the data is that there is not much difference between charter schools and public schools when it comes to scores. 
Montgomery High School has the most students with 2038. One last discovery is the 11th graders had the best overall mean scores.
